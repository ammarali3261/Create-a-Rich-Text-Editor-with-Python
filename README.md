# Create-a-Rich-Text-Editor-with-Python
 PyQt5 is the latest iteration of the Python binding for the cross-platform Qt GUI toolkit, implemented as a plugin.  In this session, we’ll use PyQt5 to code our own customizable rich text editor a la Microsoft Word. We’ll implement file system interactions, selective text formatting, and other features one expects from a modern word processor.   Prerequisites: — Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/) — Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
